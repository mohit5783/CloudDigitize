## Design Considerations for CloudDigitize

### Microservice Architecture

CloudDigitize adopts a microservice architecture to enable modularity, scalability, and independent deployment of backend services. Each backend application/service is implemented as a separate microservice, facilitating agility and scalability.

### Asynchronous Processing

CloudDigitize leverages asynchronous processing for the digitization process. Backend services communicate asynchronously using message queues or event-driven architectures like AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) or EventBridge. This approach ensures efficient resource utilization and improved throughput for data processing.

### Stateless Design

The backend services in CloudDigitize are designed as stateless components. This stateless architecture allows for better scalability, fault tolerance, and simplified horizontal scaling.

### High Availability

CloudDigitize achieves high availability by deploying the application across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within an AWS region. Load balancers such as AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or Application Load Balancer (ALB) distribute traffic across instances, ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance.

### Cost Optimization Strategies


CloudDigitize incorporates cost optimization strategies, including:

- Utilizing AWS Spot Instances for non-critical components to take advantage of unused EC2 capacity at reduced prices.
- Leveraging AWS Auto Scaling to dynamically scale resources based on demand, optimizing costs during peak and off-peak periods.
- Implementing data lifecycle policies to move infrequently accessed files to cheaper storage tiers like Amazon S3 Glacier or Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
- Utilizing AWS Cost Explorer and AWS Budgets to monitor and analyze costs, enabling proactive cost management and optimization.

By considering these design considerations, CloudDigitize achieves a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective architecture. It leverages microservices for flexibility, asynchronous processing for improved throughput, stateless components for scalability, high availability for resilience, and cost optimization strategies for efficient resource utilization.

## Description of CloudDigitize Architecture

The architecture of CloudDigitize embraces a microservices approach, where the frontend UI enables users to submit files for the digitization process. The uploaded files are stored in Amazon S3, providing secure and scalable storage. The digitization process itself involves three backend microservices, which can be deployed using AWS Lambda functions or containers. Each microservice is triggered by a message from an SQS queue or an event from EventBridge, ensuring the sequential movement of data across the backend applications.

The backend microservices process the data in a sequential manner, where the output of one microservice serves as the input for the next microservice. The processed files are stored back in Amazon S3, ensuring the persistence of the digitized output. To notify the client, a notification can be sent through various means such as email, SMS, or by updating a status in a database.

User authentication is a critical aspect of the architecture, and it is addressed using AWS Cognito. This service provides a fully managed solution for user authentication and access control, ensuring secure access to the CloudDigitize application. User credentials and access policies are managed centrally, allowing fine-grained control over user permissions and authentication methods.

For application deployment, a robust CI/CD pipeline is established using AWS CodePipeline. The pipeline integrates with AWS CodeCommit for source code hosting, AWS CodeBuild for build and test stages, and Elastic Beanstalk or ECS for deployment. With the pipeline in place, any changes committed to the CodeCommit repository trigger the pipeline, automatically building, testing, and deploying the application. This CI/CD setup ensures efficient and reliable application updates, reducing human error and enabling rapid delivery of new features and bug fixes.

To ensure high availability, CloudDigitize is deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within an AWS region. Load balancers such as AWS Elastic Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer distribute traffic evenly among instances deployed in different AZs, providing redundancy and fault tolerance. Auto-scaling capabilities dynamically adjust the number of instances based on demand, ensuring the application can handle varying workloads. Database replication or managed database services with built-in high availability features, such as Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment, guarantee data persistence and availability in case of failures.

To monitor the performance and health of the application, CloudDigitize incorporates AWS CloudWatch, which collects and monitors logs, metrics, and events. Custom alarms can be set up to trigger notifications based on specific metrics, allowing proactive identification of issues. AWS X-Ray provides distributed tracing and performance analysis, enabling developers to analyze the application's behavior and optimize performance.

Regarding non-functional requirements (NFRs), the architecture design of CloudDigitize focuses on various aspects. Performance is optimized through efficient data processing and file handling, ensuring quick response times and a smooth user experience. Scalability is achieved by horizontally scaling the microservices and utilizing auto-scaling features to meet varying demand. Security is ensured through AWS IAM for fine-grained access control, encryption mechanisms for data at rest and in transit, and adherence to AWS security best practices. Reliability is enhanced through fault-tolerant designs, redundancy, and backup mechanisms to minimize downtime and ensure the availability of the application. Maintainability is facilitated by adopting infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation and version control with AWS CodeCommit, enabling easy updates, reproducibility, and maintainability of the CloudDigitize architecture.

In summary, CloudDigitize leverages the power of AWS services to create a scalable, secure, and highly available architecture for file digitization. The CI/CD pipeline automates the deployment process, ensuring efficient and reliable updates. High availability is achieved through deployment across multiple AZs and load balancing, while NFRs such as performance, scalability, security, reliability, and maintainability are carefully considered to provide an optimal user experience and operational excellence.
